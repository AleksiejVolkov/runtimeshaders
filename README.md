# Shader Experiments Repository
Welcome to the Shader Experiments Repository! This repository is dedicated to various shader experiments, with each experiment hosted in its own branch. The main branch contains only the basic initial setup, serving as the foundation for all shader experiments.

## Structure
main: The main branch contains the very basic initial setup. It serves as the foundation for all shader experiments. You can use this setup to start your own experiments or to explore the different branches.
Experiment Branches: Each shader experiment is contained within its own branch. This structure allows for isolated development and testing of individual shader effects.

## How to Use

### Cloning the Repository
To clone the repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/shader-experiments.git
cd shader-experiments
```

### Checking Out a Specific Experiment
To explore a specific shader experiment, you need to check out the corresponding branch. Here’s how you can do it:

List All Branches: To see all available experiments, list the branches:

```bash
git branch -a
```
Check Out a Branch: Use the checkout command to switch to the branch containing the shader experiment you’re interested in:

```bash
git checkout branch-name
//Replace branch-name with the name of the branch you want to explore.
```

### Running the Experiments
Each branch contains specific instructions on how to run the shader experiment. Generally, you will need to open the project in your preferred development environment and run it according to the instructions provided in that branch’s README or documentation file.

### Adding New Shader Experiments
If you want to add a new shader experiment, follow these steps:

Create a New Branch: Create a new branch for your experiment from the main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b my-new-shader-experiment
```

Develop Your Shader: Add your shader code and any necessary files to this new branch.

Commit and Push: Commit your changes and push the branch to the repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new shader experiment"
git push origin my-new-shader-experiment
```

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have a shader experiment you’d like to share, please follow the steps above to create a new branch and submit a pull request.
